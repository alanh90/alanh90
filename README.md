# Hello, I'm Alan Hourmand ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a passionate AI enthusiast and generalist based in the US. With a lifelong fascination for artificial intelligence, I've been diving deep into AI development over the past few years, especially since the recent advancements in Large Language Models. My goal is to become an experienced AI cognitive architect, focusing on creating more human-like AI systems.

## ðŸŽ® Background
I have over 10 years of experience in video game development, working with both Unreal Engine and Unity. This background in interactive, real-time systems provides a unique perspective on AI development and human-computer interaction.

## ðŸ”­ Current Project
[BicameralAGI](https://github.com/alanh90/BicameralAGI) - An ambitious open-source project of mine exploring novel AI architectures inspired by the bicameral mind theory. This project aims to create more human-like AI by implementing a multi-system architecture that mimics the complexity of human cognition.

## ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning
- Advanced AI architectures and cognitive modeling
- Emotional intelligence implementation in AI systems
- Ethical considerations and alignment in AI development
- Cutting-edge developments in Large Language Models
- Techniques for creating more generalized AI systems
- Implementation of alternate transformer architectures
